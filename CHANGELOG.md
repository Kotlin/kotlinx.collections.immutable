## 0.3.1

- Update Kotlin version up to 1.3.70

## 0.3

- Turn the JVM-only project into a multiplatform library
    * Builder iterators are fast-fail only on JVM. On the other platforms modifying the builder during iteration not through the corresponding iterator can invalidate the iterator state in an unspecified way.
    * In addition to JVM and JS platforms, macosX64, iosX64, iosArm64, iosArm32, linuxX64, and mingwX64 native platforms are supported.
- Make conversion to persistent collections consistent
    * `toPersistentMap`/`Set` always returns an ordered persistent map/set
    * `toPersistentHashMap`/`Set` always returns an unordered persistent map/set
    * `toImmutableMap`/`Set` may return any kind of immutable map/set
- Optimize persistent list [builder] batch update operations
    * `addAll(elements)` operation performs ~3 times faster :chart_with_downwards_trend:
    * `addAll(index, elements)` operation takes O(N + M), down from O(N * M), where N is the size of this collection and M - the size of the `elements` collection. :chart_with_downwards_trend:
    * `removeAll(elements)` operation takes O(N * K), down from O(N * M), where K is the time complexity of `contains` operation on the `elements` collection :chart_with_downwards_trend:
    * `removeAll(predicate)` operation takes O(N * P), down from O(N * (P + N)), where P is the time complexity of the `predicate` algorithm :chart_with_downwards_trend:
- Implement set/map backing trie canonicalization
    * `add` operation after `remove` operations performs ~20% faster :chart_with_downwards_trend:
    * iteration after `remove` operations performs ~3 times faster :chart_with_downwards_trend:

## 0.2

#### Split immutable and persistent interfaces

- Immutable collections specify by their contract the real immutability of their implementors
    * `ImmutableCollection` extends read-only `Collection`
    * `ImmutableList` extends read-only `List` and `ImmutableCollection`, and overrides `subList` method that returns `ImmutableList`
    * `ImmutableSet` extends read-only `Set` and `ImmutableCollection`
    * `ImmutableMap` extends read-only `Map`, and overrides `keys`, `values` and `entries` properties types with `ImmutableSet`, `ImmutableCollection` and `ImmutableSet` respectively
- Persistent collections extend immutable collections and provide modification operations that return new instances with the modification applied 
    * `PersistentCollection` extends `ImmutableCollection`, and provides modification operations and builder
    * `PersistentList` extends `ImmutableList` and `PersistentCollection`, and provides modification operations
    * `PersistentSet` extends `ImmutableSet` and `PersistentCollection`, and provides modification operations
    * `PersistentMap` extends `ImmutableMap`, and provides modification operations and builder
- `plus`, `minus` and `mutate` extension functions are available only for persistent collections
- Deprecate `immutableXOf()` top-level functions and introduce `persistentXOf()` 
- `toImmutableX()` extension functions return `ImmutableX`
- Introduce `toPersistentX()` extension functions that return `PersistentX`
- Document public API

#### Replace PCollection-based prototypes with custom performant implementations

 - `PersistentList` implementation is backed by a bit-mapped trie with branching factor of 32
    * `add(element: E)` and `removeAt(size - 1)` operations take O(1) time, down from O(log<sub>2</sub>n) :chart_with_downwards_trend:
    * `get` and `set` operations take O(log<sub>32</sub>n), down from O(log<sub>2</sub>n) (though the same asymptotic) :chart_with_downwards_trend:
    * Iteration has the same time complexity of O(n), but much faster in practice due to the better reference locality :chart_with_downwards_trend:
 - Unordered `PersistentSet` implementation is backed by a hash-array mapped trie (a.k.a. HAMT) with up to 32 children or elements in a node
    * `contains`, `add` and `remove` operations take O(log<sub>32</sub>n) time, down from O(log<sub>2</sub>n) :chart_with_downwards_trend:
    * Iteration has the same time complexity of O(n), but much faster in practice due to the better reference locality :chart_with_downwards_trend:
 - Unordered `PersistentMap` implementation is backed by a compressed hash-array mapped prefix-tree (a.k.a. CHAMP) with up to 32 children or entries in a node
    * `contains`, `get`, `put` and `remove` operations take O(log<sub>32</sub>n) time, down from O(log<sub>2</sub>n) :chart_with_downwards_trend:
    * Iteration has the same time complexity of O(n), but much faster in practice due to the better reference locality :chart_with_downwards_trend:
 - Ordered `PersistentSet` implementation is backed by the unordered `PersistentMap` which maps elements in this set to next and previous elements in insertion order
    * `contains`, `get` and `put` operations take O(log<sub>32</sub>n) time, down from O(log<sub>2</sub>n) :chart_with_downwards_trend:
    * `remove` operation takes O(log<sub>32</sub>n) time, down from O(n) :chart_with_downwards_trend:
    * Iteration takes O(n log<sub>32</sub>n) time, up from O(n) :chart_with_upwards_trend:
 - Ordered `PersistentMap` implementation is backed by the unordered `PersistentMap` which maps keys in this map to values, next and previous keys in insertion order
    * `contains`, `get` and `put` operations take O(log<sub>32</sub>n) time, down from O(log<sub>2</sub>n) :chart_with_downwards_trend:
    * `remove` operation takes O(log<sub>32</sub>n) time, down from O(n) :chart_with_downwards_trend:
    * Iteration takes O(n log<sub>32</sub>n) time, up from O(n) :chart_with_upwards_trend:
 - Builders are backed by the same backing storage as the corresponding persistent collections, but apply modifications in-place if the node has already been copied
    * Time complexities of all operations are the same as of the corresponding persistent collections. However, avoiding memory allocations leads to significant performance improvement :chart_with_downwards_trend:
